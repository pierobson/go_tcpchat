# go_tcpchat

Really simple Go tcp chat client/server that works over the local network. I hardcoded my local ip for now but I'll fix that in a bit. Just getting used to Go as I've never used it before.

This will eventually be updated to be an exercise in creating a file sharing protocol with Google protobufs.
